### **Option 3: Manual Step-by-Step Process**

#### **Step 1: Create a Sermon**
```ruby
# In Rails console (rails console)
sermon = Sermon.create!(
  title: "The Power of Prayer",
  scripture: "Matthew 6:9-13",
  pastor: "Pastor Smith",
  church: "Community Faith Church",
  interpretation: "Jesus taught us how to pray with the Lord's Prayer. This model prayer shows us the importance of approaching God with reverence, seeking His will, asking for provision, forgiveness, and protection from temptation.",
  action_points: "1. Set aside daily prayer time\n2. Use the Lord's Prayer as a guide\n3. Pray for others, not just yourself\n4. Listen for God's voice",
  source_url: "https://example.church/sermons/power-of-prayer"
)
```

#### **Step 2: Generate Video Script**
```ruby
# Schedule video generation
video = sermon.schedule_video_generation!(1, {
  style: 'engaging',
  target_audience: 'general'
})

puts video.script
```

#### **Step 3: Approve Video**
```ruby
# Check current status
puts video.status  # => "pending"

# Approve the video
video.approve!
puts video.status  # => "approved"
```

#### **Step 4: Process Video**
```ruby
# Manual processing (normally automatic)
VideoProcessingJob.perform_now([video.id])

# Check final status
video.reload
puts video.status          # => "uploaded" (if successful)
puts video.youtube_url     # => YouTube link
```
