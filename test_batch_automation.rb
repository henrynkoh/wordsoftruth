# Test the new landing page and batch processing system
puts "📋 Testing components:"
puts "1. ✅ Landing page view (sermon_automation/index.html.erb)"
puts "2. ✅ Controller (SermonAutomationController)"
puts "3. ✅ Background job (SermonBatchProcessingJob)" 
puts "4. ✅ Progress tracking view (batch_progress.html.erb)"
puts "5. ✅ Routes configuration"

puts "- Start automation: POST /start_automation"
puts "- Batch progress: GET /batch_progress/:id"
puts "- Batch status API: GET /batch_status/:id"

puts "📝 How it works:"
puts "1. User visits landing page and enters sermon URLs"
puts "2. System validates URLs and creates batch processing record"
puts "3. Background job processes each URL:"
puts "   - Extracts sermon content (title, scripture, interpretation)"
puts "   - Creates sermon record"
puts "   - Generates video script"
puts "   - Creates MP4 video with Korean TTS"
puts "   - Uploads to YouTube Shorts automatically"
puts "4. Progress page shows real-time updates"
